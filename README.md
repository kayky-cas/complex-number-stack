# Complex Number - Stack

Complex number is an element of a number system that extends the real numbers with a specific element denoted i, called the imaginary unit and satisfying the equation i^2 = âˆ’1. Every complex number can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers. Because no real number satisfies the above equation, i was called an imaginary number. For the complex number a + bi, a is called the real part and b is called the imaginary part.
